# Coding Test for Flexisource

This is the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ERrrItXy/coding-test-flexisource) for this small project. I use trello to manage time efficiently and divide a big task into smaller ones.

This is the [Deployed Version](https://codingtest-flexisource-abnwpq849.vercel.app) for the app which does not need any set up. This is done under the assumption that the one that will be checking the project is not a developer.

However if you are a developer, `git cloning` this project and running `npm i` and `npm run dev` will allow you to access the project in your local machine since I have included the `.env` file. The localhost will be [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

I added validations, limit the page to just one, and allos some animations to make it a little bit more user-friendly. The site is also mobile-responsive. I could have made it using Python but I have more experience with Python so it might not be as impressive. I have no professional experience with `Typescript` and `NextJs` which you can see through my resume and [Website](https://mark-atienza.com).

I will be adding more projects on my portfolio this week and updating my portfolio to a better UX design in the future.

> I don't memorize everything but I know where and how to figure it out.

Just a note that I have created a PostgreSQL instance with heroku solely for this test and the credentials is available on the `.env` file. This is of course unsecure for production but knowing that this is for a test. It will be kept as is to immediately connect to my instance. I could have created the `environment variables` on production but that would require you to copy it if you were gonna use it on your local machine, thus my decision to place it inside the git version control.
